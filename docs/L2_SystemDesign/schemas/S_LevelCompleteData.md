# L2 Schema: LevelCompleteData

The `LevelCompleteData` schema defines the structure of the ephemeral payload object used when transitioning from `InGame` to `LevelComplete`.

This object is generated by the `GameplaySystem` upon successful level completion. It contains a detailed breakdown of the player's performance during that level. The `StorySystem` uses this data to display a level summary screen before the final results are committed to the persistent `GameSession.scoring` object.

## Schema Definition

```typescript
interface LevelCompleteData {
  /**
   * Base score awarded for completing the level's primary objective.
   */
  baseScore: number;

  /**
   * The final time taken to complete the level, in seconds.
   * This is typically copied from GameSession.scoring.currentLevelTime.
   */
  timeCompleted: number;

  /**
   * Bonus points awarded based on how quickly the level was completed,
   * as calculated by the GameplaySystem.
   */
  timeBonus: number;

  /**
   * Bonus points awarded for the number of enemies defeated.
   */
  enemiesDefeatedBonus: number;

  /**
   * The total score for this level, representing the sum of the base
   * score and all bonuses. This value is used for display and is then
   * added to the main GameSession.scoring.totalScore.
   */
  levelTotalScore: number;
}
