# L2 System Design

This level contains the detailed design of the application's components. It is divided into two main categories: `Modules` and `Schemas`.

### Modules

Modules are the active, logical components of the game. Each document describes the responsibilities, state, and behavior of a specific module.

*   [M_GameManager](./modules/M_GameManager.md)

### Schemas

Schemas are the passive data structures of the game. They define the shape of data that is passed between modules or persisted.

*   [S_GameSession](./schemas/S_GameSession.md)
