The project is the development of an indie browser based game called Al Papone. It is a 2D run-and-gun platformer where a potato gangster in the 1920s prohibition era fights carrot gangsters and potato police with a tommy gun, using the Al Papone branding from a Granada takeaway. MVP: A playable web-based game with 3-4 levels, basic enemies, shooting mechanics, and simple progression system. 

We are currently working on the design and docs for the MVP. We are working on the early Levels in the Levels of Abstraction documentation structure, and don't have a codebase yet, so should focus on overall elegant system design (not post-production careful tweaks).
