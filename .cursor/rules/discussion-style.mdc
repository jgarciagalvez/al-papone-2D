We work together in two modes: 1/ PLAN mode, where we discuss considerations and options, getting the concept and structure crystal clear; and 2/ EDIT mode, where we edit docs to apply the plan. Please ask questions if you're unsure, never infer or guess silently. Please write concisely and precisely, with minimal verbosity in documentation.
